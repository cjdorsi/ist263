                    <h4>Chris gave this book 5 stars</h4>
                    <p>"I loved everything about The People We Keep, beginning with the narrator, April Sawicki, who is both wise beyond her years and unbelievably naive, to the fact it's 1994 and no one has a cell phone. Allison Larkin has given us a heroine who is raw and real, a young person capable of breaking your heart one moment and lifting it up the next."</p>

I swear, I don't think I've felt this many emotions from a book in a long, long time. It made me feel happiness, sadness, rage, and love â€” sometimes all at the same time."</p>

A tale of survival, isolation, class, love, childhood trauma, nostalgia, & our connection to this beautiful Earth. I found myself so enwrapped in the story, so much so, that I found myself crying. I've never cried from a book before."</p>

                    <p>"Here is an illustrative tale of what it was like to be a black maid during the civil rights movement of the 1960s in racially conflicted Mississippi. There is such deep history in the black/white relationship and this story beautifully shows the complex spectrum, not only the hate, abuse, mistrust, but the love, attachment, dependence."</p>

                    <h4>Thomas gave this book 5 stars</h4>
                    <p>"I slept with this book after I read it. I kid you not: I held its bulking, hardcover bound 700 pages in my arms as I fell asleep amid a raging storm. I refused to let A Little Life leave me. Its brilliant writing, its broken characters, and its bleak, unforgiving story dug into my heart, into the very pores of my skin. As a twenty-year-old, I felt both so young and so old upon finishing this novel, as if its sheer humanity aged my soul while making me appreciate all the years I still have left."</p>

                    <h4>Sofia gave this book 5 stars</h4>
                    <p>"Crying in H Mart is my favorite book of all time. The quiet devastation, the raw emotion, the sheer wisdom inside its pages. It brought tears to my eyes practically every other page. I've never gone through such an emotional journey triggered by a book before. The sense of impending doom and the heavy sadness of each moment, the conflicting emotions and frank writing style, the haunting dialogue and the stunning descriptions of food."</p>

Ultimately, though, it's personal relationships, communication, love, and sex that the characters must navigate, as they desperately try to identify beauty in their everyday encounters."</p>
