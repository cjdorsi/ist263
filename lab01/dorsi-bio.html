    <body>
    My name is Charlotte D’Orsi, I am an Advertising and Information Management & Technology major at Syracuse University interested in strategic media planning in digital advertising. I am an honor’s student and the current Strategy Director of Syracuse’s student-run ad agency—TNH. I am skilled at performing market research using MRI Simmons and Mintel, I am knowledgeable of the Adobe creative suite, I have experience using Python, and I can speak French and Italian. Outside of work and school, I enjoy reading, crocheting, and watching shows like Law and Order SVU and The Office. My favorite book is A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith. I am from Ventura, California and am looking forward to moving back to the west coast once I graduate college.
